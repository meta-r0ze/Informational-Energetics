\section{System 1: The Lattice Substrate and the Geometric Invariants}
\label{sec:system1}

Having established that the vacuum must be a Discrete, Self-Dual, and Causal information processing substrate we now identify the one unique mathematical structure that satisfies these constraints.

Through a process of elimination we first determine the geometry of the lattice itself before projecting it into spacetime.

\subsection{The Lattice Selection (\texorpdfstring{$E_8$}{E8})}
\label{sec:derivation_a}
\label{sec:lattice_selection}

We now determine which of these permitted dimensions satisfies the remaining constraints of persistence.

\subsubsection{The \texorpdfstring{$n \equiv 0 \pmod 8$}{neq0mod8} Constraint}
\label{sec:kneserstheorem}
The requirement of an even, self-dual lattice is remarkably restrictive. A result from lattice theory, Kneser's Theorem \cite{kneser_klassenzahlen_1957}, states that even, self-dual lattices only exist in dimensions that are multiples of 8. This immediately eliminates the vast majority of dimensionalities leaving only: 

\[ D \in \{8, 16, 24, \dots\} \]
This strictly eliminates any lattice solution in dimensions $D<8$ including $D=4$ (Standard Relativity) or $D=10$ (Superstring Theory) as they cannot support a self-dual unitarity condition without auxiliary structures.

\subsubsection{The Principle of Minimum Configurational Entropy}
\label{sec:principleofminconfigentropy}
To minimize the Entropic Action of the substrate, the system must not only minimize geometric complexity (dimension) but also eliminate arbitrary selection parameters. We analyze the population of even, self-dual lattices permitted by Kneser's Theorem ($D = 8k$):

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{D=8:} A unique solution exists (The $E_8$ lattice).
    \item \textbf{D=16:} Two distinct solutions exist ($E_8 \oplus E_8$ and $D_{16}^+$).
    \item \textbf{D=24:} Twenty-four distinct solutions exist (The Niemeier lattices).
\end{itemize}

A vacuum established at $D=16$ would possess an irreducible \textbf{Configurational Entropy} of $S_{config} = k_B \ln(2)$, representing the information required to distinguish between the two topological isomers. A vacuum at $D=24$ would have $S_{config} = k_B \ln(24)$.

The $E_8$ lattice ($D=8$) is the unique solution where $S_{config} = k_B \ln(1) = 0$. It is selected not merely for its low dimensionality, but because it is the only self-dual geometry that forms a deterministic ground state without inherent topological ambiguity.



\subsection{The Projection (\texorpdfstring{$D=4$}{D=4} and \texorpdfstring{$\nu=16$}{nu=16})}
\label{sec:derivation_b}
The $E_8$ lattice cannot process information by itself. Processing requires a flow (Input vs. Output). The system must break the $E_8$ symmetry to distinguish the ``Observer'' (Spacetime) from the ``System'' (Internal States).

\subsubsection{The Symmetric Decomposition (Space vs. Charge)}
\label{sec:symmetricdecompostion}
The projection must preserve the self-duality property in the subsystems to maintain local conservation. The unique symmetric splitting of $E_8$ is:
\begin{equation}
    E_8 \to D_4 \oplus D_4
\end{equation}

While other decompositions exist (e.g., $E_8 \to A_8$), the $D_4 \oplus D_4$ split is the unique decomposition among maximal rank subgroups that preserves the self-duality of the subspaces \cite{conway_sphere_1988}. By Conway \& Sloane, other maximal subgroups (e.g., $A_8$, $D_8$) fail to preserve the integer norm condition required for a unitary lattice projection without introducing scaling factors that break self-duality.

This decomposition partitions the 8 dimensions into two orthogonal sectors with distinct physical roles:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sector A (External Spacetime):} The first $D_4$ lattice defines the coordinate addresses of the lattice nodes. Since $\text{Rank}(D_4)=4$, the observable universe is strictly fixed at \textbf{$D=4$}.
    \item \textbf{Sector B (Internal Symmetry):} The second $D_4$ lattice encodes the internal state (charge, spin, isospin) at each coordinate. These dimensions do not manifest as spatial directions but as the \textbf{Gauge Symmetries} of the Standard Model.
\end{enumerate}
This structural partition explains why the universe appears 4-dimensional while possessing complex internal forces, without requiring the hidden spatial dimensions of Kaluza-Klein theory.

\subsubsection{The Bit-Depth of the Node (\texorpdfstring{$\nu = 16$}{nu16})}
\label{sec:chiralcapacity}

We must determine the information capacity (Bit-Depth) of the lattice nodes. What is the minimal geometric structure required to define a persistent, distinguishable signal on the lattice?

The $E_8 \to D_4 \oplus D_4$ decomposition creates a local geometry governed by $Spin(8)$. However, this structure faces critical information-theoretic limitations that prevent it from satisfying the \textbf{Identity} and \textbf{Causality} pillars.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{The Identity Constraint:} 
    The spinor representations of $Spin(8)$ are mathematically \textbf{Real}, meaning a state vector is identical to its conjugate ($\psi = \bar{\psi}$). In signal processing terms, this means a system built on this logic cannot distinguish a signal from its inverse (Phase Ambiguity), because it lacks complex phase information. To support a stable Identity, the system requires \textbf{Complex Representations} ($\psi \neq \bar{\psi}$), allowing for the encoding of phase information distinct from amplitude.
    
    \item \textbf{The Causality Constraint:} 
    To support the \textbf{Causality} pillar (Arrow of Time), the system must distinguish ``Input'' from ``Output.'' Geometrically, this requires \textbf{Chirality}, the ability to distinguish Left-handed projections from Right-handed projections. Spin(8) is \textbf{Achiral}. Odd-dimensional rotation groups (like $Spin(9)$) possess complex spinors but are also achiral.
    
    \item \textbf{The Minimal Extension:} 
    We seek the minimal geometric group rank that satisfies both conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Complex (to encode Phase/Identity)
        \item Chiral (to encode Flow/Causality)
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The smallest group containing $Spin(8)$ that supports both complex and chiral representations is $Spin(10)$. No intermediate group between $Spin(8)$ and $Spin(10)$ admits both properties.

The size of the fundamental data packet (spinor) in this minimal valid geometry is:
\begin{equation}
    \nu = 2^{\frac{10}{2}-1} = 2^4 = \mathbf{16}
\end{equation}

Thus, $\nu = 16$ is not an arbitrary particle count; it is the geometric Bit-Depth sufficient to encode complex, directed information on the lattice.

\paragraph{Physical Correlate:} 
This geometry, established strictly to satisfy informational constraints, necessarily manifests as the existence of \textbf{Fermions} (Matter). The Complex requirement ($\psi \neq \bar{\psi}$) creates the distinction between Matter and Antimatter. The Chiral requirement creates the Parity violation observed in the Weak Interaction. These are not inputs to the theory, but inevitable consequences of the system's requirement for directed information processing.

\paragraph{The Total Node Capacity ($N$)}
\label{sec:spacen}
We determine the total information capacity of a single lattice node by summing the degrees of freedom of its constituent sectors.

As derived in \cref{sec:symmetricdecompostion}, the projection $E_8 \to D_4 \oplus D_4$ creates two orthogonal, symmetric subsystems. In \cref{sec:chiralcapacity}, we established that each sector requires a bit-depth of $\nu=16$ to support complex, chiral information. 

Because the projection preserves the \textbf{Self-Duality} of the substrate, the two sectors must remain informationally symmetric (balanced capacity). Therefore, the total channel capacity $N$ is simply the sum of the two sectors:
\begin{equation}
    N = \nu_{\text{Sector A}} + \nu_{\text{Sector B}} = 16 + 16 = \mathbf{32}
\end{equation}

This integer $N = 32$ represents the total number of distinct state channels that the system must map onto the temporal dimension without collision.

\subsection{The Operating System (Metric Signature)}
\label{sec:metric_signature}

\subsubsection{The Goal}
We have established a manifold with $D=4$ dimensions and a signal capacity of $\nu=16$ channels. The system must now instantiate an algebraic \textit{Metric Signature} capable of encoding these 16 data channels onto the 4-dimensional geometry without loss or ambiguity.

\subsubsection{The Requirements}
To map the 16-channel signal onto a 4-dimensional manifold, the metric algebra must satisfy two strict encoding constraints:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complex Compression (Identity):} The 16 real channels must be compressed into 8 complex degrees of freedom ($16\mathbb{R} \to 8\mathbb{C}$). This requires the algebra to natively generate a geometric imaginary unit ($i$) to encode phase information.
    \item \textbf{Chiral Sorting (Causality):} The system must distinguish ``Input'' from ``Output'' to enforce the arrow of time. This requires the algebra to support orthogonal projectors ($P_L, P_R$) that split the signal into directed halves ($8\mathbb{C} \to 4\mathbb{C}_L + 4\mathbb{C}_R$).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{The Search Space}
A 4-dimensional manifold admits two fundamental metric signatures. We test each against the requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Option A: Euclidean Metric $(+,+,+,+)$.} 
    In a space where all dimensions are spatial, the volume element (pseudoscalar $\omega$) squares to positive unity ($\omega^2 = +1$). 
    \item \textbf{Option B: Lorentzian Metric $(-,+,+,+)$.} 
    In a space with one temporal dimension, the volume element squares to negative unity ($\omega^2 = -1$).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Unique Solution}
The Euclidean metric fails the encoding test. Because $\omega^2 = +1$, the algebra is strictly Real (quaternionic). It cannot generate the imaginary unit $i$ required for compression, nor can it support complex chiral projectors. A universe with this signature would be a static, real-valued block with no capacity for phase or flow.

The \textbf{Lorentzian Metric} is the unique valid solution: $(1,3)$ is equivalent to $(3,1)$ by reordering, and $(2,2)$ fails because $\omega^2 = +1$ in split signature, restoring the real algebra. Because $\omega^2 = -1$, the volume element functions as the geometric imaginary unit ($i \equiv \omega$). This naturally generates the complex structure required to compress the signal ($\nu=16$) and the chiral structure required to sort it.

\textbf{Conclusion:} The signature $(3,1)$ is not an arbitrary choice of physics; it is the only algebraic structure capable of processing the system's information content. Physically, the negative sign of Time ($dt^2 < 0$) is the geometric cost required to generate the imaginary unit $i$.

\paragraph{Physical Consequence (Matter and Antimatter)}
Once these algebraic structures are established to satisfy the encoding requirement, they manifest in physics as fundamental properties of matter. The \textbf{Matter/Antimatter} distinction emerges from the complex conjugation ($\psi \leftrightarrow \bar{\psi}$) enabled by the imaginary unit. \textbf{Chirality} emerges from the orthogonal projectors. These are not postulates, but unavoidable consequences of encoding a 16-dimensional state of an 8-dimensional lattice onto a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold.

\subsubsection{The Spatial Degrees of Freedom (\texorpdfstring{$D_{space} = 3$}{Dspace3})}
\label{sec:spatial_freedom}

Finally, we determine the dimensionality of the spatial sector. The Causality pillar enforced a Lorentzian metric $(3,1)$, separating the manifold into one temporal dimension and three spatial dimensions.

This value $D_{space}=3$ is not arbitrary; it is the \textbf{Topological Stability Threshold} required by the \textbf{Persistence Margin} pillar.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Knotting Condition:} For a topological defect (a particle) to persist as a distinct entity from the vacuum, it must possess a non-trivial winding number (it must be a "knot" in the field).
    \item \textbf{The Constraint:} Knot theory dictates that a closed loop cannot be knotted in fewer than 3 dimensions (in 2D, any loop is equivalent to a circle). If the spatial embedding were $D < 3$, the topological defect would self-intersect and collapse.
\end{itemize}

Thus, the integer $3$ represents the minimum spatial embedding required to prevent the topological collapse of the Identity. This geometric constraint manifests in the impedance calculation (\cref{sec:geometric_impedance}) as the phase space volume scaling ($N^{D_{space}} = N^3$), defining the probabilistic measure of the node.

\subsection{The System Logic (\texorpdfstring{$\sigma$=5}{sigma=5} and \texorpdfstring{$\chi$=2}{chi=2})}
\label{sec:derivation_d}
\label{sec:system4_derivationd_sytem_logic}
We derive the rank of the interaction symmetry ($\sigma$). This derivation is supported by two converging lines of evidence: one from Group Theory (Algebraic) and one from Manifold Geometry (Geometric).

\subsubsection{The Topological Boundary (\texorpdfstring{$\chi=2$}{chi=2})}
For a particle to be distinct from the vacuum, its boundary must strictly separate the universe into two disjoint sets: ``Inside'' (The System) and ``Outside'' (The Environment).  We assert that the topological boundary of a persistent particle must be a sphere ($\chi=2$) as the \emph{unique} solution to the \textbf{Binary Partition Constraint}.

We derive this by analyzing the Euler Characteristic for closed, orientable surfaces:
\begin{equation}
    \chi = 2 - 2g
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the genus (number of holes).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Exclusion of $g \geq 1$ (The Leaky Partition):} Any topology with one or more holes (Torus $g=1$, Double Torus $g=2$, etc.) fails to define a strict binary separation.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Information-Theoretic Failure:} A genus $g \geq 1$ surface is not simply connected. It supports non-contractible loops—paths that thread through the holes without intersecting the surface. This creates informational ambiguity: field lines can interact with the topology without being ``enclosed,'' rendering the definition of total charge ambiguous (Gauss's Law fails).
        
        \item \textit{Thermodynamic Failure:} By the Gauss-Bonnet theorem ($\int_M K \, dA = 2\pi\chi$), any surface with $g \geq 1$ has $\chi \leq 0$, implying neutral or negative total curvature. Such a surface cannot support net positive internal pressure (energy density) against the vacuum, it would structurally collapse.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{The Uniqueness of $g=0$ (The Sphere):} The sphere is the unique closed surface with $g=0$, yielding $\chi=2$, the maximum possible value. It is the only simply connected topology, ensuring that all loops contract to a point. This forces every field line to be explicitly either contained or excluded, enabling the perfect binary partition of state required for a persistent, distinguishable particle.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Physical Consequence: Charge Quantization}
The invariant $\chi=2$ is the \emph{necessary and sufficient} condition for \textbf{charge quantization}. Because $\chi$ must be an integer and $\chi=2$ is the unique maximum for closed surfaces, the charge associated with this topology is discrete. You can have 1 sphere or 2 spheres, but not 1.5 spheres. This geometric constraint allows the continuous lattice field to support discrete, countable units of charge.

\subsubsection{The Interaction Symmetry (\texorpdfstring{$\sigma=5$}{sigma=5})}
\label{sec:sigma}

We derive the interaction rank $\sigma$ from the independence of \textbf{Configuration} (Location) and \textbf{Definition} (Boundary).

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Geometric Necessity (The State Vector):}
    A persistent particle state $\psi$ is fully defined only when we specify both its external coordinates and its internal topology. The minimal embedding vector space $V$ must span these two distinct domains.
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Spatial Freedom ($D_{space} = 3$):} 
        The \textbf{Causality} pillar requires that one dimension of the $D=4$ manifold be allocated to the update stream (Time). This leaves $D-1=3$ dimensions for spatial configuration. (Note: This segregation is required by the Causality pillar regardless of the specific metric signature derived later).
        
        \item \textbf{Topological Freedom ($D_{boundary} = 2$):} 
        The \textbf{Identity} pillar requires the particle to be distinguished from the vacuum by a closed boundary. As derived in the Topological Boundary section, the unique simply-connected solution is the sphere ($S^2$). While a sphere is embedded in 3 dimensions, it is a 2-manifold; it requires exactly \textbf{2 intrinsic parameters} (e.g., $\theta, \phi$) to specify the topological state at the boundary.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{The Orthogonality Condition:}
    A fundamental requirement of the \textbf{Homogeneity} defined in System 0 is that the internal definition of a particle (its boundary topology) must be independent of its location. 
    
    Mathematically, this requires the total state space to be a \textbf{Direct Product} of the spatial manifold and the internal boundary manifold ($V_{total} = V_{space} \times V_{boundary}$). Because the boundary definition does not depend on position, their vector spaces are orthogonal.
    
    The dimension of the minimal interaction embedding is the sum of these independent sectors:
    \begin{equation}
        \sigma = \dim(V_{space}) + \dim(V_{boundary}) = 3 + 2 = \mathbf{5}
    \end{equation}
    
    \item \textbf{Algebraic Confirmation:} 
    This geometric value $\sigma=5$ matches the \textbf{Dimension of the Fundamental Representation} of $SU(5)$, the minimal Grand Unified Theory group \cite{georgi_unity_1974}. In this framework, the 5-component GUT vector is simply the algebraic representation of the geometric degrees of freedom derived above.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{The Fundamental Resonance (\texorpdfstring{$\Delta=43$}{Delta=43})}
\label{sec:fundamental_resonance}
\label{sec:derivation_e}
Finally, we derive the fundamental frequency of the lattice. This is the only dynamic integer in the set. It must satisfy three simultaneous filters to support a persistent universe.

\subsubsection{Filter 1: Unitarity and The Uniqueness Constraint}
\label{sec:fundamental_resonance_filter1}
For information to be conserved (Unitarity), the evolution of a state must be unambiguous and perfectly reversible. We translate this physical requirement into a mathematical one by postulating that the algebraic structure governing the lattice dynamics must be a \textbf{Unique Factorization Domain (UFD)}.

The reason is information-theoretic: in a discrete causal set, the \textit{history} of a state is defined by the sequence of algebraic operations (factors) that generated it. If the algebraic field has a class number $h > 1$, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic fails; a single state norm can be decomposed into multiple non-equivalent sets of prime factors.

This creates \textbf{Causal Ambiguity}: the system cannot uniquely reconstruct its past from its current state. This violates the Unitary requirement of information conservation ($ \psi^{\dagger}\psi = 1 $). Therefore, for a universe to preserve its own history (Unitary), the underlying lattice algebra must be a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), strictly requiring $h=1$.

The Stark-Heegner theorem \cite{stark_complete_1967} is a mathematical classification result, not a physical 
postulate. It provides the complete, finite list of values for $\Delta$ that satisfy the requirement of $h=1$:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \in \{1, 2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163\}
\end{equation}
These nine \textbf{Heegner numbers} are the only candidates for the fundamental resonance of a unitary universe.

\subsubsection{Filter 2: Causality (The ``Bandwidth'' Constraint)}
\label{sec:fundamental_resonance_filter2}
To apply the causality constraint, we use the total information capacity ($N$) of the $E_8$ lattice substrate. This integer $N=32$ represents the total number of distinct state channels that must be mapped onto the temporal dimension without collision.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Problem:} The system must map these $N=32$ parallel channels onto the serial timeline defined by $\Delta$. If the timeline cycle ($\Delta$) is shorter than the number of channels ($N$), the \textbf{Pigeonhole Principle} forces at least two distinct states to map to the same time coordinate. This creates ``Causal Aliasing'' (a signal collision), which destroys the history of the system.

    \item \textbf{The Constraint:}: To ensure every state has a unique temporal address and to maintain a non-zero persistence margin against fluctuations, the projection must satisfy the strict inequality $\Delta > N$. Therefore, we require $\Delta > 32$.
    
    \item \textbf{Remaining Candidates:} Applying this constraint to the set of Heegner numbers leaves: $\{43, 67, 163\}$.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Filter 3: Temporal Atomicity (The Coordination Constraint)}
\label{sec:fundamental_resonance_filter3}

The temporal modulus $\Delta$ is defined by Filter 1 as the \textbf{fundamental, indivisible clock period}. This atomicity requirement imposes a strict upper bound on the cycle length.

While the physical consequence of this bound is the stabilization of the \textbf{Spinor Double Cover}\footnote{
    \textbf{Physical Anticipation:} Fermions live on the spinor double cover of the manifold, requiring a $4\pi$ rotation ($\psi \to -\psi \to \psi$) to return to identity. This implies the effective information content is doubled ($2N$).
    For the temporal coordinate to resolve this topology without ambiguity, the lattice update cycle $\Delta$ must maintain \textbf{Phase Lock} with the signal. If the non-signaling guard interval ($M = \Delta - N$) exceeds the signal length ($N$), the phase history is lost in the gap. 
    Mathematically, strict causality requires $\Delta < 2N$. If $\Delta \ge 2N$, the vacuum gap exceeds the particle coherence length, creating \textbf{Topological Aliasing} where the phase winding number becomes undefined, destroying fermionic statistics.
}, System 1 must depend only the principles of Information Energetics to derive it. We do not assume fermions exist yet; we assume only a system optimizing for persistence.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Mechanism (Signal vs. Overhead):} 
    The fundamental cycle $\Delta$ partitions into $N=32$ active signal states (the information payload) and $M = \Delta - N$ overhead intervals (the processing latency or guard bands).
    
    \item \textbf{The Constraint (Causal Continuity):} 
    Because $\Delta$ is atomic (possessing no faster internal clock), the $M$ overhead intervals cannot be self-regulating; they must be causally bridged by the active signal states. If an overhead interval exists without a corresponding signal controller, the system experiences an \textbf{Acausal Gap}—a period of time defined by the metric but undefined by the state.
    
    \item \textbf{The Proof (Surjective Mapping):} 
    To maintain causal continuity, every overhead interval must be mapped to at least one controlling signal state. Mathematically, let $S$ be the set of signal states ($|S|=N$) and $O$ be the set of overhead intervals ($|O|=M$). The system requires a \textbf{Surjective Function} $f: S \twoheadrightarrow O$.
    
    By the definition of surjection, the domain must be greater than or equal to the codomain ($|S| \ge |O|$).
    \begin{equation}
        N \ge M \implies N \ge (\Delta - N) \implies \Delta \le 2N
    \end{equation}
    With $N=32$, the hard upper limit for the atomic update cycle is $\Delta \le 64$. This eliminates both $67$ and $163$, leaving $\Delta = 43$ as the unique solution.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Result:} $\Delta = 43$ is the unique solution satisfying Unitarity (Filter 1), Causality (Filter 2), and Temporal Atomicity (Filter 3).

\subsection{The System Specification}
\label{sec:system1spec}
The $E_8$-Persistence theory fulfills the six pillars of persistence with a substrate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Substrate: Manifold Rank} ($D=4$)
    \item \textbf{Capacity ($CAP$): Fundamental Resonance ($\Delta=43$).} The maximum non-repeating frequency of the lattice (Heegner Number), representing the bit-depth of the vacuum.
    \item \textbf{Map ($MAP$): Interaction Symmetry ($\sigma=5$).} The geometric rank required to encode the unified force ($SU(5)$ precursor).
    \item \textbf{Protocol ($PRO$): Chiral Capacity ($\nu=16$).} The active degrees of freedom available for matter storage (The Weyl Spinor).
    \item \textbf{Governor ($GOV$): Topological Boundary ($\chi=2$).} The Euler characteristic required for closed loops (stable particles), enforcing the finiteness of the field.
    \item \textbf{Toll ($TOL$): Metric Signature ($-1$).} The causal cost of state updates, enforcing the Arrow of Time via the Lorentzian signature.
    \item \textbf{Margin ($MAR$): Spatial Embedding ($D_{space}=3$).} The minimum spatial dimensionality required to support stable topological knots ($N^3$ Volumetric scaling).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion: The Geometric Singularity}
We have now completed the derivation of the vacuum's fundamental hardware. The constraints of Finiteness, Unitarity, and Causality have led us not to a family of possibilities, but they converge on a single, overdetermined geometric object: the $E_8$ lattice projected onto a causal $D=4$ manifold.

This projection is not specified by adjustable parameters. It is characterized by five derived invariants—integers that represent how the geometry answers the persistence requirements:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{S} = \{D=4, \Delta=43, \nu=16, \sigma=5, \chi=2\}
\end{equation}

This set represents the complete and immutable specification of System 1. These are not free parameters or empirical inputs; they are the derived architectural constants of a persistent reality. \Cref{sec:geometric_impedance} will calculate the vacuum's geometric impedance from this unified structure as its sole input to perform the theory's first physical calculation.
