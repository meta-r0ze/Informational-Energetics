\section{Geometric Origin of Chiral Fermions}
\label{app:geometric_origins_of_chiral_fermions}

The Standard Model exhibits a puzzling asymmetry: only left-handed fermions participate in weak interactions. In the $E_8$-Persistence framework, this chirality is not imposed but \textbf{emerges} from the geometric projection of a symmetric structure onto asymmetric spacetime.

\subsection{The Projection Mechanism}
The $E_8$ lattice is Euclidean with signature $(8,0)$, perfectly symmetric between all eight dimensions. Physical spacetime, however, is Lorentzian with signature $(1,3)$. The projection map:
\begin{equation}
    E_8 \subset \mathbb{R}^{8,0} \xrightarrow{\mathcal{P}_{\text{chiral}}} M^{1,3}
\end{equation}
involves a \textbf{signature change} that fundamentally alters the geometric structure.

\subsection{Why Projection Creates Chirality}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Clifford Algebra Mismatch:} The Clifford algebra of the lattice is $Cl(8,0)$, which admits only real spinors. The Clifford algebra of spacetime is $Cl(1,3) \cong M_4(\mathbb{C})$, which admits complex spinors with definite handedness.
    \item \textbf{The Chiral Filter:} To project from real $(8,0)$ to complex $(1,3)$ without creating negative-norm states (which violate unitarity), the projection must select only one chiral component. This is encoded in the projector:
    \begin{equation}
        P_L = \frac{1 - \gamma^5}{2}
    \end{equation}
    where $\gamma^5$ is the volume element of the 4D Lorentzian subspace. This is not an arbitrary choice, it is the \textbf{geometric consequence} of signature reduction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Distinction from Algebraic Embeddings}
This mechanism resolves the constraints identified by Distler and Garibaldi. Their "No-Go" theorem rigorously proves that \textit{signature-preserving} algebraic embeddings within $E_8$ cannot accommodate chiral fermions without mirror partners.

Our framework operates in a complementary domain:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Method:} Discrete Geometric Projection (vs. Continuous Algebraic Embedding).
    \item \textbf{Signature:} Changes from $(8,0) \to (1,3)$ (vs. Preserved Signature).
    \item \textbf{Result:} Mirror fermions are geometrically orthogonal to the observer's timeline, rather than being algebraically eliminated.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the chiral asymmetry of the Standard Model is identified as the artifact of projecting a real, symmetric, Euclidean geometry onto a complex, causal, Lorentzian timeline.
