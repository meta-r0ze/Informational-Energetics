\section{Geometric Origin of Chiral Fermions}
\label{app:geometric_origins_of_chiral_fermions}

Distler and Garibaldi provided a rigorous service to the field of physics by demonstrating that a continuous, algebraic embedding of the Standard Model within $E_8$ cannot accommodate chiral fermions without introducing unobserved ``mirror fermions.''

The $E_8$-Persistence framework circumvents this ``No-Go'' theorem by operating in a fundamentally different mathematical domain: \textbf{Geometric Projection} rather than Algebraic Embedding. As derived in \cref{sec:metric_signature}, the chirality of the Standard Model emerges not from the Lie algebra itself, but from the metric signature change required to project the Euclidean lattice onto a causal Lorentzian manifold.

This appendix summarizes that derivation specifically within the context of the Distler-Garibaldi constraints, demonstrating that our mechanism does not contradict their theorem but lies outside its assumptions.

\subsection{The Distler-Garibaldi Constraint}
The theorem holds for all \textbf{signature-preserving} embeddings, where the algebraic structure of the vacuum remains Euclidean or Compact ($8,0$). Under these conditions, the embedding is achiral; for every left-handed fermion, a right-handed mirror partner must exist to preserve the symmetry of the group.

\subsection{The Geometric Resolution: Signature-Induced Chirality}

The $E_8$-Persistence theory utilizes \textbf{Metric Projection} involving a signature change ($8,0 \to 3,1$). By explicitly changing the metric signature, the projector $P_L$ acts as a \textbf{Chiral Filter}.

The introduction of the time-like metric axis forces the decoupling of the ``Mirror'' sector to preserve norm positivity. The mirror fermions required by $E_8$ symmetry still exist in the mathematical structure of the lattice, but they reside in the orthogonal $D_4$ complement (Sector B).

Crucially, the temporal metric signature ($dt^2 < 0$) is unique to the spacetime sector (Sector A). The mirror sector remains purely Euclidean ($4,0$) relative to the observer. Lacking a timelike coordinate, the mirror states possess no generator for time evolution ($\partial_t \psi_{mirror} = 0$).

Therefore, the mirror fermions are \textbf{geometrically orthogonal} to the observer's timeline. They are not erased; they are causally disconnected. They cannot propagate as dynamic fields in the Lorentzian manifold, effectively rendering the observable physics chiral without violating the underlying $E_8$ symmetry.
