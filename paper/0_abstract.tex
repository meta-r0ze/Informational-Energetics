We present Informational Energetics (IE), a unified framework for modeling the persistence of complex adaptive systems against entropy. By synthesizing non-equilibrium thermodynamics, control theory, and algorithmic information theory, we derive the Universal Architecture of Persistence: a recursive, six-dimensional set of constraints (Capacity, Identity, Protocol, Governor, Temporal Cost, and Persistence Margin) that any system must satisfy to maintain structural coherence.

We demonstrate that the ``Laws of Physics" are not arbitrary axioms but are the emergent hydrodynamic limits of this architecture applied to the fundamental substrate of the vacuum. This paper establishes the theoretical foundation for the $E_8$-Persistence Theory, showing that the geometric invariants of the Standard Model are the necessary solutions to the IE Impedance Equation. This paper establishes the ``System 0" constraints: Finiteness, Unitarity, and Causality that dictate the geometric structure of reality, providing the foundation for subsequent derivation of the Standard Model.
