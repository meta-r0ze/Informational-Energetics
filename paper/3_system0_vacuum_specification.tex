\section{System 0: The Specification of the Vacuum}
\label{sec:System0_vacuum_specification}

The principles of Informational Energetics, if truly universal, must apply to the most fundamental layer of reality: the vacuum itself. We now perform the critical act of translation, applying the universal architecture of persistence to this specific domain. This approach treats the universe not as a given, but as a physical system subject to the same architectural constraints governing information, energy, and stability that are necessary for any entity to persist.

This translation of IE's universal principles into the specific language of physics yields three non-negotiable, abstract requirements for the substrate of reality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Finiteness:} To prevent energetic and informational divergence.
    \item \textbf{Unitarity:} To ensure the lossless conservation of information.
    \item \textbf{Causality:} To enforce a well-defined temporal evolution.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this section will derive these three properties in detail, building the complete abstract specification for a persistent universe.

\subsection{Persistence Requires Finiteness}
For the vacuum to persist, its definition must be self-consistent. A system defined by infinite properties contains no information and cannot maintain a stable structure. In physics, such inconsistencies manifest as energetic divergences, as exemplified by the Ultraviolet (UV) Catastrophe in standard Quantum Field Theory, where assuming a continuous spacetime leads to an infinite energy density. IE resolves this by enforcing finiteness as a primary requirement of existence. This corresponds to the \textbf{Capacity} and \textbf{Persistence Margin} pillars.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Logic:} Information is physical and requires energy to store \cite{landauer_irreversibility_1961}. A continuous volume, containing infinite potential information, would therefore possess infinite energy and instantly collapse into a singularity.

    \item \textbf{The Requirement:}
    To prevent Energetic Divergence, the substrate must be \textbf{Discrete}. There must exist a fundamental, indivisible unit of information that sets a maximum density.

    To prevent Algorithmic Divergence, the substrate must be \textbf{Homogeneous}. The information required to describe the structure must be independent of its size (constant). This requires that the local topology of a storage cell be the same regardless of location, minimizing the structural description to a single, repeating rule.

    \item \textbf{Specification:} The universe must be a  \textbf{Lattice Field}, a structure that is both discrete (finite) and translationally invariant (ordered) rather than a continuous manifold or a random graph.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Persistence Requires Unitarity}
For the vacuum to persist, it must maintain a stable identity over time. This requires that information is perfectly conserved. Since the vacuum \textit{is} the environment, there is no external system to which information can be lost. Therefore, the vacuum must be a perfectly closed and lossless information network. This is the requirement of Unitarity, which maps to the \textbf{Protocol} and \textbf{Identity} pillars.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Logic:} In any information network (for example electrical circuits and fiber optics), signal integrity is maximized when the impedance of the source matches the impedance of the load. A mismatch creates irreversible information loss. To create a perfectly lossless network, the vacuum must be perfectly impedance-matched to itself at all points. 

    \item \textbf{The Requirements:}
    To ensure the system has a stable ground state (a `floor' to the energy well), the structural metric must be \textbf{Positive Definite} (Euclidean). A signature containing negative components (Lorentzian) would allow infinite negative energy states, violating the finiteness requirement.
    
    To conserve information density throughout the projection, the lattice fundamental domain must have unit volume, making it \textbf{Unimodular}.

    For the information network to be truly lossless, the encoding basis must be discrete and orthogonal, preventing infinitesimal state overlap. Mathematically, this demands that all lattice vector norms are even integers ($\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{v} \in 2\mathbb{Z}$), making the lattice \textbf{Even}.

    \textbf{The Information-Theoretic Necessity:}
    While theoretical physics has long established that self-consistent quantum vacuum must be Even to satisfy \textbf{Spin}\footnote{\textbf{Physical Anticipation:} The necessity of evenness for consistent projection is historically rooted in the analysis of modular forms by Serre \cite{serre_course_1973}, who demonstrated that even, self-dual lattices exist only in dimensions divisible by 8. Physically, this constraint is required to support Spin in a Lorentzian manifold. As established by Green and Schwarz \cite{green_anomaly_1984}, only specific even lattice structures allow for anomaly-free projections, ensuring the preservation of unitarity and the correct definition of fermionic currents.},
    we derive this constraint here strictly from the \textbf{Identity} pillar of persistence, without assuming a priori physical laws.   
    
    A persistent system must possess a unique, path-independent equilibrium state at every temperature. If the entropy $S = -\sum p_i \ln p_i$ depended on thermal history rather than current state alone, the system would violate the Identity pillar ($\Delta I$), its definition would be ambiguous.
    
    \textit{Mathematical Translation}:The complete statistical description of the system is encoded in the partition function $Z(\beta) = \text{Tr}(e^{-\beta H})$ which enumerates accessible states at inverse temperature $\beta$. For the equilibrium to be unique (history-independent), this state-counting function must be single-valued, it cannot depend on the path taken to reach temperature T.
    
    This uniqueness requirement translates to a mathematical constraint: $Z(\beta)$ must yield consistent state counts under all equivalent parameterizations of the thermal ensemble. 
    
    % TODO overyly complex...
    These parameterizations are the modular transformations ($\tau \to \tau+1$ and $\tau \to -1/\tau$), which correspond to exchanges of temperature and geometric scales. \textbf{Crucially, single-valuedness under these transformations is the mathematical expression of path-independence.}
    
    An even lattice ensures this consistency. Its theta function $\Theta_\Lambda(\tau) = \sum_{\mathbf{v} \in \Lambda} q^{|\mathbf{v}|^2/2}$ has integer coefficients with no half-integer shifts, making it modular invariant. Any odd-norm vector would introduce a branch cut in the state-counting function, breaking this invariance and representing irreversible information loss (Landauer erasure) at the ground state.

    Having established that the lattice must be Even, we now derive the requirement that it be Self-Dual. To prevent information loss via destructive interference or Landauer erasure, the encoding operation (write) and the decoding operation (read) must be informationally equivalent.      Mathematically, the lattice must be identical to its reciprocal (Fourier dual), making it \textbf{Self-Dual} ($\Lambda = \Lambda^*$). This ensures that the structural metric is its own inverse, allowing for lossless signal propagation without basis transformation penalties.

    \item \textbf{Specification:} The lattice of the vacuum must be \textbf{Positive Definite, Unimodular, Even, and Self-Dual}.

    \item \textbf{Note on Metric Signature:} The Positive Definite (Euclidean) condition applies to the substrate lattice in its full dimensionality to ensure a stable energy floor. A Lorentzian signature ($3,1$) at the substrate level would introduce negative norm states (ghosts), violating Finiteness. The observed Lorentzian signature of spacetime is not a property of the lattice itself, but emerges strictly from the \textit{Causal Projection} derived in \cref{sec:causal_projection}. % TODO fix citation, was in the removed appendix
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Persistence Requires Causality}
For the vacuum to persist, it must not only exist stably but also \textit{evolve} in a well-defined manner. This creates a fundamental information-theoretic challenge: how to project the vast state space of a lattice node onto a single, linear temporal axis without ambiguity. This maps to the \textbf{Governor} and \textbf{Temporal Cost} pillars.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The Logic:}
    Consider a lattice node with a total internal state capacity of $N$ distinct information channels (degrees of freedom). To evolve, the system must map these $N$ parallel states onto a serial timeline defined by a fundamental integer cycle, the \textbf{Temporal Modulus} ($\Delta$).
    
    By the \textbf{Pigeonhole Principle}, if the timeline's cycle length ($\Delta$) is shorter than the number of state channels ($N$), at least two distinct states must map to the same temporal index. This creates \textbf{Causal Aliasing}—a collision where distinct information states become indistinguishable in time, effectively destroying the system's history.

    \item \textbf{The Requirement:}
    To enforce a strict arrow of time, the system must implement a \textbf{Geometric Governor} that prohibits aliasing.
    
    The condition $\Delta = N$ represents a critically saturated channel (analogous to the Nyquist Limit). However, at this critical point, any perturbation (thermal noise or quantum fluctuation) causes aliasing. For a system to persist \textit{robustly} across cosmic time scales, it must operate with a non-zero margin. Therefore, the temporal container must be strictly larger than the information content it holds.

    \item \textbf{Specification:}
    The projection must satisfy the strict inequality $\Delta > N$. The vacuum is defined by a \textbf{Causal Projection} where the update cycle length exceeds the node capacity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary: The Architectural Specification of the Vacuum}
From the Axiom of Persistence, we have derived three non-negotiable architectural constraints for the substrate of reality: \textbf{Finiteness, Unitarity and Causality}. These constraints constitute the complete specification of System 0. These constraints imply the following requirements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discrete}, required by Finiteness.
    \item \textbf{Even, Unimodular and Self-Dual}, required by Unitarity.
    \item Capable of a \textbf{Causal Projection} satisfying $\Delta > N$, required by Causality.
\end{enumerate}

With this specification, the physical substrate is no longer an open exploration search but a constrained problem: find the unique mathematical object that satisfies all three requirements simultaneously.
