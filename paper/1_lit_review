Brief note: "While several discrete spacetime approaches exist (Causal Sets, LQG), these are physics-first derivations. Our approach is systems-first; spacetime emerges from persistence constraints, not vice versa."

I.C Relationship to Existing Frameworks
"Several research programs share conceptual overlap with our approach:
Discrete Spacetime: Causal Set Theory (Bombelli et al., 1987) and Loop Quantum Gravity (Rovelli & Smolin, 1995) treat spacetime as fundamentally discrete. However, these frameworks do not predict Standard Model parameters. We extend discrete geometry to particle physics by deriving gauge structure and coupling constants from E8 lattice topology.
Emergent Gravity: Verlinde (2011) and Padmanabhan (2010) derive gravitational dynamics from thermodynamic principles. Our framework generalizes this: all forces emerge as entropic flows on the lattice, recovering the full SM Lagrangian (Paper I, Section V).
Mass Relations: Empirical formulas (Koide, 1982) fit particle masses using algebraic numbers. Our approach differs by deriving masses from lattice resonances (∆ⁿ) via geometric impedance (Paper II), yielding parameter-free predictions rather than post-hoc fits.


The structural requirements we derive (Capacity, Identity, Protocol, Governor, Temporal Cost, Margin) synthesize principles from control theory [Ashby, Wiener], non-equilibrium thermodynamics [Prigogine], and algorithmic information theory [Solomonoff, Kolmogorov]. However, we do not assume these principles; we derive them as the minimal complete set required for any system to resist thermodynamic equilibrium (Section II).
This framework has been developed and validated across biological, economic, and computational domains over two decades. The present work tests its universality by applying it to the vacuum—a system with zero environmental inputs and parameters measured to 12 significant figures. If IE correctly predicts the Standard Model constants without tuning, this validates the framework's claim to universality.
I.C.3 Distinction From Physics-First Approaches
Several research programs explore discrete spacetime structures (Causal Set Theory [Bombelli et al.], Loop Quantum Gravity [Rovelli, Smolin]) or emergent gravity (Verlinde, Jacobson). These are physics-first approaches: they begin with spacetime or gravity and work forward.
Our approach is systems-first: we derive universal persistence requirements, then show that the vacuum—treated as a persistent system—must satisfy them. The Standard Model emerges as a consequence, not a starting assumption. This yields predictions (α⁻¹, fermion masses, mixing angles) that physics-first approaches do not address, while simultaneously explaining why the SM has the structure it does (gauge groups, generation count, etc.).
A detailed comparison of derivation strategies is provided in Appendix [X].
